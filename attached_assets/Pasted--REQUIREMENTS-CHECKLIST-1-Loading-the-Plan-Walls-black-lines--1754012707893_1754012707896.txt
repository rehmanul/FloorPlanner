For an Uploaded File:
The app processes the file and displays an empty (base) floor plan view with only walls, restricted areas, and entrances—matching the style of Image 1. (must be real parsing for every unique files)

After Placement:

Once îlots and corridors are placed, the detailed view overlays these elements interactively (matching Images 2/3).

The UI/UX:
Is modern, stylish, and user-friendly—using attractive background images from Pexels and consistent, professional color schemes and typography.

Export Options:
Provide users with intuitive options to export high-quality output.

Technical Feasibility


Rules for corridors:

1.	 If two rows of islands are facing each other, a corridor must be automatically created between them.

2.	 Width of the configurable corridor (e.g. 1.2 m or other value entered by the user).

3.	 The corridor must:

•	 Touch the islands on each side

•	 Never cut or overlap an island

4.	 The placement must remain optimized and compact, while respecting:

•	 The walls (black)

•	 Prohibited areas (blue)

•	 Input/output (red)


✅ Visual objective:

***The generated plan must looks like a real layout, as in an open space or a furnished room - not just a stack of islands***

make the size of the corridors  by default 1m20
